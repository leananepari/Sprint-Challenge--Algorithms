#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)
O(N)
There are several operations but the simplified complexity is O(n) since the times loop/operations run depends on the number n.

b)
O(Log N)
there are two nested loops but the inner loop's variable is increased exponentially by a constant amount.

c)
